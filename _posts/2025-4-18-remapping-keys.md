title: Re-mapping keys in macOS
---

Like most people, I'm particular about what's on my desk, and all of my various tweaks, macros, etc. that I use to make my time working comfortable and productive.

I prefer a pretty spartan setup: a mouse, a keyboard, my computers, and that's about it. Even then, most things are minimal and out of the way. In this vein, my keyboard of choice for this desk is the [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXCL3LL/A/magic-keyboard-usb-c-us-english), although I only have the Lightning version.

This keyboard is great for my purposes, although I can understand why it might not be others' cup of tea. However, one minor gripe I have is that there is no right control key on the keyboard. This is pretty annoying, because since I mouse with my left hand, I typically rely heavily on the right-side control key for switching desktops in macOS. And given that I never use the right option key, it makes a great candidate for mapping to the right control button.

Sadly, Apple *does* provide a means of mapping modifier keys, but they aren't specific to individual keys, meaning I can only map *both* option keys, or none.

For things like this in the past, I used [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), which always worked well, but was definitely way overkill for my needs. This time, I wanted something a little simpler, and something that I'd be able to run across my work computer without requiring a new [Santa](https://github.com/northpolesec/santa) (binary authorization) allowlist rule or a [system extension](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#allow-system-software-which-provides-virtual-devices-for-karabiner-elements).

Fortunately, Apple provides a way to do exactly that. From a [technical note from 2017](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2450/_index.html):
> This Technical Note is for developers of key remapping software so that they can update their software to support macOS Sierra 10.12. We present 2 solutions for implementing key remapping functionality for macOS 10.12 in this Technical Note.


In that technical note, the two methods they describe are:

1. Scripting Key Remapping: Using the `hidutil` command-line tool
2. Programmatic Key Remapping: Using IOKit HID APIs 

The first method will work perfectly for my use case. According to the Key Table Usages at the bottom, I would need to map the Usage ID of 0xE6 to 0xE0.

Using the example `hidutil` command provided, that looks something like this:

```bash
hidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping":[{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x7000000E6,"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x7000000E0}]}'
```

After running that in my terminal, I was able to confirm this would work.

However, this change will be lost upon reboot. To make this change persistent across reboots, I opted to use a [LaunchAgent](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html), which will issue the `hidutil` command upon each login.

To do this, I created `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sbenson.remapkeys.plist` with the following content:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
                       "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<!-- See https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2450/_index.html for more on HID key remapping -->

<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.sbenson.remapkeys</string>

    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/bin/hidutil</string>
        <string>property</string>
        <string>--set</string>
        <string>{"UserKeyMapping":[{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x7000000E6,"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x7000000E0}]}</string>
    </array>

    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>

    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/remapkeys.out.log</string>

    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/remapkeys.err.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

All I did next was reboot and confirm that my changes remained upon login.
