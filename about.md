## 👋 Hey, I’m Sean

I’m a **security engineer** who spends most days wrangling macOS, building tools, and figuring out how to make security actually work at scale. I like clean systems, clever automation, and the occasional deep dive into how Apple’s ecosystem ticks.

This blog is where I share ideas, notes, and things I’ve learned from the security and platform trenches.

### Outside of work

You’ll usually find me:

- 🏋️ lifting weights  
- 📸 taking photos  
- 🗾 studying Japanese  
- 🚶‍♂️ going on long walks to nowhere in particular

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to [reach out via email](mailto:sbenson@hey.com) if you ever want to say hello.
